# Project Kickoff & Planning

## Vision
To create an all-in-one platform that seamlessly connects **Personal Support Workers (PSWs)** with individuals and families who require their services.  
The goal is to simplify the process of finding, booking, and managing PSW services while ensuring trust, transparency, and accessibility.

## Scope
The project will focus on building a **full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** web application that enables:
- Clients to search, view, and book PSWs.
- PSWs to create and manage professional profiles.
- A secure messaging system for communication.
- Reviews and ratings for quality assurance.
- A dashboard for both PSWs and clients to track bookings, payments, and schedules.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Elderly individuals, people with disabilities, or families who need personal support care.  
- **Secondary:** Professional PSWs seeking job opportunities and flexible work management.

## Problem Statement
Finding reliable, trustworthy, and available Personal Support Workers is a **time-consuming and fragmented process**.  
Families often rely on word-of-mouth, scattered job boards, or agencies that charge high fees. Similarly, PSWs struggle to showcase their skills, gain visibility, and manage schedules.  

**This project aims to build a centralized platform** where both clients and PSWs can connect directly, reducing friction, improving accessibility, and ensuring quality care.

## Objectives
1. Build a secure and user-friendly platform for clients and PSWs.  
2. Enable PSWs to showcase skills, availability, and certifications.  
3. Provide clients with easy booking and communication tools.  
4. Integrate reviews and ratings to ensure transparency.  
5. Lay the foundation for scalable future features (payments, insurance integration, AI-matching, etc.).
